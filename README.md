# cakecircleproject

Welcome to the readme!
This project is designed to help people study circles in computer science.
It is currently in a planning and design state and is incomplete.
It uses a modified Bresenham circle drawing algorithm that to my knowledge is free.

It should be free open source software under GPL v 3
it is a work in progress.
